However, I soon realized that I had overlooked the crucial step of brainstorming and developing my essay topic, which my lecturer had emphasized as a key factor in improving my grade. To rectify this, I made sure to thoroughly brainstorm and gather ideas before starting my next essay. In order to make my point clear, I provided the example of Swedish service as a form of currency. To further illustrate my point, I used the analogy of a walnut, showing how each aspect of a project is interconnected and important. Additionally, I emphasized the importance of collaboration and teamwork by mentioning the act of holding hands with fellow musicians. In my pursuit of perfection, I made sure to carefully plan and execute each step of the process.
