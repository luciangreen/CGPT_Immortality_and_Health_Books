Define the relationships between actions and objects. For example, \"preparing\" requires a tarpaulin, \"sitting\" requires a tarpaulin and can only be done under it, \"snuffing\" requires an éclair, etc.\n\n4. Create a main goal, such as \"preparing to make an Aboriginal humpy\". This goal will be achieved by performing a series of actions in a specific order.\n\n5. Use Prolog's built-in predicates, such as \"assert\" and \"retract\", to keep track of the state of the scenario. For example, when the person \"sits\" under the tarpaulin, the fact \"under_tarpaulin\" can be asserted.\n\n6. Use Prolog's built-in predicates, such as \"findall\" and \"member\", to check if the necessary conditions for each action are met. For example, before \"preparing\" to make an Aboriginal humpy, the algorithm can check if the person has a tarpaulin by using the fact \"has(tarpaulin)\".\n\n7.

Repeat the process until the main goal is achieved, or until the algorithm reaches a dead end and cannot continue.\n\n9. Once the main goal is achieved, the algorithm can output a success message and possibly suggest other actions that can be performed based on the current state of the scenario.\n\nThis algorithm can be modified and expanded to include more actions and objects, as well as more complex relationships between them.
