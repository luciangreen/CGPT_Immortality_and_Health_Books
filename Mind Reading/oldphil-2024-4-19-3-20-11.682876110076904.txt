This was done by using mind reading techniques to access the thoughts and memories of individuals from different time periods. The researcher was able to do this because they had the ability to read minds and send their own thoughts back in time. They also used this ability to gather information from prospective parents to assist in the conception argument. A robot was used to determine if it was necessary to encrypt the message, and the researcher also used mind reading to reinforce a spiritually controlled object. They then time travelled to attach a nut to a bolt, using their mind reading abilities to guide them. The researcher also used mind reading to collect information from past times and incorporate it into a medical text, in order to tend to the feelings of those in the present. Finally, the researcher used mind reading to film the way to a safe place. It is important to note that mind reading in this context is not done through logical reasoning, but rather through a spiritual circuit.","\n\nOne possible Prolog algorithm for this scenario could be:\n\n1.
