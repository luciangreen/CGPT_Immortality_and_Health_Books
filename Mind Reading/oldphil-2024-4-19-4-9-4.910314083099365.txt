This predicate will be used to spiritually time travel the person's thoughts to them.\n\n4. Define a predicate \"mind_state(Idea)\" that takes in an idea and stores it as a paronomastic idea.\n\n5. Define a predicate \"check_product(Product)\" that takes in a product and checks it against breasonings currency. This predicate will be used to ensure that the product is safe for use.\n\n6. Define a predicate \"positive_paths(Product)\" that takes in a product and checks if it follows positive paths. This will be used to ensure that the product is beneficial.\n\n7. Define a predicate \"spiritual_screen(Person, Thoughts)\" that takes in a person and their thoughts and uses a spiritual screen to check if the thoughts are positive and beneficial.\n\n8. Define a predicate \"verify_health(Person)\" that takes in a person and checks if they have any aches or pains after time travel. This will be used to ensure the safety of the person during time travel.\n\n9. Define a predicate \"blend_texts(Text1, Text2, Blended)\" that takes in two texts and blends them together to create a new text. This will be used to blend the two mind read texts.\n\n10. Define a predicate \"teleport(Reality, Text)\" that takes in a reality and a text and teleports the robot to that reality based on the text.\n\n11. Define a predicate \"interesting(Text)\" that takes in a text and checks if it is interesting. This will be used to check the output from mind read times.\n\n12. Define a predicate \"mind_test(Person)\" that takes in a person and checks if they have laughed. This will be used to ensure that the person is in a positive state of mind.\n\n13. Define a predicate \"review_rights(Robot)\" that takes in a robot and performs all the necessary actions to review its machine learning rights. This will involve using all the defined predicates to mind read, encrypt, time travel, mind state, check product, check positive paths, use the spiritual screen, verify health, blend texts, teleport, check for interesting output, and mind test the person.\n\n14. Call the \"review_rights\" predicate with the appropriate arguments to review the robot's machine learning rights."]]
