In some cases, this ability can also be used to travel through time and experience different moments in history. However, in order to prevent harm from being caused by the time traveler, a simulated intelligence is needed to detect any potential harm before it occurs.

This phenomenon cannot be responded to or controlled, as it is a natural occurrence.
