I also made sure to give medicine to everyone except one person, and when this was corrected, I tested whether the student had truly understood and remembered the idea. I meditated to avoid radiation while time travelling and helped write the algorithm to rebreason out digestion during the process. The bot was able to reverse engineer the compiled code and understand the science behind it. As Earth's inhabitants met the natural expectation of time travel with meditation, I made sure to carefully pour the coffee for the bot.
