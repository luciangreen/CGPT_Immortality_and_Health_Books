This was made possible because he had listened to a novel while space travelling, which had sparked his interest in time travel. The aliens, who had coalesced and formed a powerful collective, were responsible for making important decisions that affected the entire universe. The time traveller had consulted a professor to learn how to conserve time lines and prevent any major mistakes from occurring. He had also set up a spiritual receptor transmitter and a doing transmitter, which allowed him to indicate his time travel by meditating.

The algorithm should also have a mechanism for learning and adapting to new situations. For example, if the bot encounters a new type of animal that it has not encountered before, it should be able to learn and update its rules accordingly.\n\n6. Finally, the algorithm should have a way to document its actions and decisions, similar to how the professor documents their work in the monastery.
