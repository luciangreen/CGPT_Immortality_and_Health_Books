The future simulation and meditation were peaceful because I incorporated advanced technology and techniques to create a harmonious environment. I discovered that people staying out of the sun was crucial for maintaining good health in the future, and I quantified this information to educate others. The handreared meditator was able to time travel due to their heightened mental abilities. The bot was programmed to navigate to the protected area to ensure the safety of the time traveller. I provided medicine to the time traveller when they needed a specific skill, such as breasoning, to successfully navigate through different time periods.

The immortal used the quantum box to prevent headaches, and time travellers confirmed the traveller's health by agreeing with God in their exposition.
