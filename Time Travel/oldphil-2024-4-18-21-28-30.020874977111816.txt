I meditated to avoid insider trading by time travelling, using the power of meditation to gain insight and prevent unethical actions. Meditation also enables writing, which helps to examine the concept of time travel and its implications. I paid in breasoning currency, a form of currency that conserves time lines, to further my exploration of time travel.
